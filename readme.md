## **📌 Installation & Setup**

### **1️⃣ Create and Activate Virtual Environment**

To keep dependencies organized, it's best to create a virtual environment:

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Streamlit App**

Launch the **Wildfire Detection UI** using:

```bash
streamlit run 1_🔥_Home.py
```

---

## **📊 How It Works**

1️⃣ **Upload an image** through the web interface.  
2️⃣ **Set confidence and IOU thresholds** for detection accuracy.  
3️⃣ **View detected wildfire zones** with bounding boxes.

### **💡 Notes on Virtual Environments in README**

✔ **Yes, including virtual environment setup in the README is recommended** for better dependency management.  
✔ **It ensures consistency** across different setups.  
✔ **Especially useful in ML/DL projects** where library versions matter.
